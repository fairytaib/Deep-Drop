## Working process
The development of Deep Drop followed a structured and iterative process, ensuring clarity and focus throughout the project. Below is an overview of the main steps involved in creating the game:

### Balsamiq wireframe

To begin the project, I created wireframes using Balsamiq. These wireframes allowed me to visualize the overall structure and design of the game. This step was crucial in translating abstract ideas into tangible layouts, ensuring that the design would align with the game's core objectives. Although some elements changed during the process the foundation was build on these wireframes.

![Wireframe mobile view](./read-me-images/wireframe/mobile-view.png)

![Wireframe start page](./read-me-images/wireframe/start-page.png)

![Wireframe class selection](./read-me-images/wireframe/class-selection.png)

![Wireframe fighting sequenz](./read-me-images/wireframe/fighting-sequenz.png)

![Wireframe fighting reward](./read-me-images/wireframe/fighting-reward.png)

![Wireframe continue sequenz](./read-me-images/wireframe/continue-sequenz.png)

![Wireframe abilitys](./read-me-images/wireframe/abilitys.png)

![Wireframe attack style](./read-me-images/wireframe/attack-style.png)

![Wireframe character stats](./read-me-images/wireframe/character-stats.png)

![Wireframe inventory](./read-me-images/wireframe/inventory.png)

![Wireframe evolutions](./read-me-images/wireframe/evolution.png)

![Wireframe classes and evolutions](./read-me-images/wireframe/classes-and-evolutions.png)

Due to the already large scale of the project i waived the additional classes and evolutions

### Miro

After the wireframe stage, I used Miro to further refine the game's structure and flow. Miro served as a dynamic tool for visualizing both the game's mechanics and its underlying code. The following diagrams were created to map out the game's logic and design:

1. General Gameflow
This flowchart outlines the player's journey through the game, from class selection to monster battles and rewards.

![Miro general javascript example](./read-me-images/miro/javascript-example.jpg)

This structured approach allowed me to stay organized and focus on the most critical elements of the project. Each step provided a clear roadmap for the development process, ensuring that all game mechanics, visuals, and interactions were cohesive and aligned with the original vision.

## Bugs Encountered, Solutions, and General Observations

### Bugs Encountered
During the development of **Deep Drop**, several challenges and bugs were encountered. Below is a summary of the most significant ones:

1. **Fighting Style Selection Not Displaying Properly**  
   - **Issue**: Fighting styles were not appearing correctly in the player menu.  
   - **Cause**: The `displayPlayerMenu` function was not appending the fighting styles due to a mismatch in variable references.  
   - **Solution**: Ensured that the correct variable (`playerAvailableFightingStyle`) was passed to the function and verified that all data structures were properly initialized before rendering.

2. **Buttons Overlapping or Misaligned**  
   - **Issue**: Buttons occasionally overlapped with other UI elements, especially on smaller screen sizes.  
   - **Cause**: CSS styling for button positioning was inconsistent across different screen sizes.  
   - **Solution**: Implemented a more robust CSS grid and flexbox system for responsive alignment. Added media queries to ensure consistent spacing and alignment on all devices.

3. **Reward Selection Not Functioning as Intended**  
   - **Issue**: Rewards (skills, items, healing) were not being added to the player's inventory or applied correctly.  
   - **Cause**: The reward selection logic did not update the corresponding player attributes or lists.  
   - **Solution**: Updated the reward selection function to directly modify `playerAvailableItems` and `playerAvailableSkills`. Added real-time feedback to confirm the reward selection.

4. **Monster and Player Health Bar Sync**  
   - **Issue**: Health values displayed during fights occasionally desynced from actual game logic.  
   - **Cause**: The health bar update function was not being called consistently after each attack.  
   - **Solution**: Ensured health bar updates were triggered immediately after health changes, using dedicated event listeners.

## Future Plans

- Add more character classes, monsters, and items to enrich gameplay.
- Introduce a story mode with narrative elements and quests.
- Implement sound effects and background music for greater immersion.
